# New Life Care App

![App Demo](./gif/new%20life%20care.gif)

New Life Care is a Flutter-based mobile app designed to provide a seamless experience for users to navigate through different screens and make selections. The app utilizes the BLoC (Business Logic Component) library to manage state and screen navigation. The final screen of the app displays a summary of selections made on the previous two screens.

## Screens

### Screen 1: Welcome and Selections
On this screen, users are greeted and presented with options to make selections that are relevant to their preferences. They can input various details and preferences that will be used in the subsequent screens.

### Screen 2: Further Customizations
This screen builds upon the selections made in the previous screen. Users are provided with additional options to refine their preferences. The selections made here will be used to tailor the user experience in the final summary screen.

### Screen 3: Summary
The last screen presents users with a summary of their selections from the previous screens. It consolidates the chosen options and displays them in text fields. Users can review their choices before finalizing and proceeding.
